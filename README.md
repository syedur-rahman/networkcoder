# NetworkCoder

The objective of **NetworkCoder** is to provide *much needed context* to the network automation space.

Beginners often struggle with automation. The key reason for this is simply the lack of perspective. Beyond simple configuration updates, what else is there to automate?

**NetworkCoder** hopes to answer this question.
